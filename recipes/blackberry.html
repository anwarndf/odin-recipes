    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>4Â½ cups fresh blackberries</li>
      <li>1cups white sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup unsalted butter, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package French vanilla cake mix</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps of creation</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Mix blackberries and sugar together in a bowl. Transfer to a 9x13-inch
        glass baking pan and spread evenly over the bottom.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle cake mix evenly over the berries. Place butter slices evenly
        over the cake mix; most of the cake mix should be covered with butter
        slices. Do not mix or stir.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown, about 45
        minutes. Serve warm.
